            Atanasoff was born on October 4, 1903 in Hamilton, New York to Ivan Atanasoff an electrical engineer of Bulgarian origin and Iva Lucena Purdy a school teacher of mixed French and Irish ancestry.
            At the age of nine he learned to use a slide rule, followed shortly by the study of logarithms, and subsequently completed high school at Mulberry High School in two years.
            Upon completion of his doctorate, Atanasoff accepted an assistant professorship at Iowa State College in mathematics and physics.
            He became known as the <em>father of the computer</em> by designing and building the Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC), the first automatic electronic digital computer. The machine was the first to implement three critical ideas that are still part of every modern computer:
          </p>
          <ol class="textMargins">
            <li>Using binary digits to represent all numbers and data</li>
            <li>Performing all calculations using electronics rather than wheels, ratchets, or mechanical switches</li>
            <li>Organizing a system in which computation and memory are separated.</li>
          </ol>
